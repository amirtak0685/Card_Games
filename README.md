# 🏰 Palace — Python Terminal Card Game

This project is a full implementation of the card game Palace written entirely in Python.
It includes full game rules, card logic, a computer opponent, hand management, and custom shuffle mechanisms.

The game runs in any terminal and requires no external libraries.

## 📦 Features

✔️ Complete Palace Rules

This implementation supports all standard Palace mechanics:
- 3 → Shadows the card below (always playable)
- 7 → Must play 7 or lower
- 2 → Resets the pile (anything can follow)
- 10 → Burns the entire pile
- Normal rule: Must play equal or higher than the effective top card
- Face-down cards are played randomly and blindly
- Always maintain at least 3 cards in hand (while draw pile exists)
- Effective top card ignores 3s stacked on top

- ✔️ Turn Phases

Each player must clear their cards in order:
- Hand cards
- Face-up cards
- Face-down cards

Face-down cards are a gamble — if the flipped card is illegal, the player must pick up the entire pile.

⸻

- ✔️ Custom Shuffle

The deck can be shuffled using:
- Fisher–Yates (perfect randomness)
- Riffle shuffle (human-style imperfect shuffle)

⸻

- ✔️ Computer Opponent

The built-in CPU:
- Follows the same rules as the player
- Chooses randomly from its valid plays
- Plays blind from face-down cards

Simple, fair, and challenging enough for casual play.

# 🚀 Getting Started

- Requirements
Python 3.8+

Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirtak0685/Card_Games.git
cd Card_Games
```

Running the Game
- python3 palace.py

# 🧠 Game Structure

- Deck Representation

Cards are stored as tuples:
("Rank", "Suit")
# Example: ("Ace", "Spades")
The deck is built with a list comprehension and then manually shuffled.

- Core Logic

- Valid Moves
All card-play logic is handled by:

can_play(card, effective_top_card)

This accounts for:
- Shadowing 3s
- The 7-or-lower rule
- Special cards (2 and 10)
- Normal rank-comparison rules

Effective Top Card

If multiple 3s are stacked on the pile, the game finds the first non-3 card below them to determine legality.

⸻

- Turn Flow

Both player and computer follow the same progression:

Hand → Face-Up → Face-Down → Win
Each phase must be completely emptied before moving to the next.


# 🏆 Winning

A player wins upon having:

0 hand cards  

0 face-up cards  

0 face-down cards  

If the opponent reaches this first, the game ends with their victory.

# 🔧 Future Enhancements

Possible extensions:
- More advanced CPU logic
- Four-of-a-kind auto-burn rule
- Ability to play multiple cards of the same value simultaneously
- Multiplayer mode
- GUI using Tkinter, PyGame, or web front-end
- Game history and logging
